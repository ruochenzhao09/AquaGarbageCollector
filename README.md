# AquaGarbageCollector
This repository hosts the code and implementation for deploying three object detection models (YOLOv5, NanoDet, and RT-DETR) for underwater trash detection using the TrashCan dataset.

# Overview
AquaGarbageCollector is designed to address the unique challenges posed by underwater trash detection. By deploying and comparing YOLOv5, NanoDet, and RT-DETR, this project provides insights into their performance and suitability for real-time applications in underwater environments.

# Data Availability
The TrashCan dataset used to test YOLOv5, NanoDet, and RT-DETR models is available at https://doi.org/10.13020/g1gx-y834.
